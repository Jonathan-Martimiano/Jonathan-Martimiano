>In this study we are going to apply Linear Regression and Neural Network models in a famous dataset called Boston Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston, in order to compare the predictive capability of a Machine Learning vs a Deep Learning model.

#### Importing libraries

```R
library("MASS")
library("rpart")
```
#### Set.Seed(0) function for standardize random data

```R
set.seed(0)
```

#### Importing Boston Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston [R - Dataset]
